<body>
<p>Structured HTML. All the markup we will ever need.</p>
<h1>Heading 1 - The top of the document</h1>
<p>Accessibility is key to everyone being able to read this one document.</p>
<h2>Heading 2 - ordering the headings</h2>
<p>A basic paragraph. In here we would let the natural reflow of the document take care of the window resizing.</p>
<blackquote>
<p>We can have a block area for a quote. It could have different borders, margins and padding. It might even have an image as part of the background.</p>
<p><cite>We might attribute the quote to someone - like me.</cite></p>
</blackquote>
<p>Add more from this point:<q>Sometimes you need to take control of the whitespace and format the layout completely</q></p>
